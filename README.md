# ios-twitter-sdk-example
An example iOS app that uses the Twitter SDK.

This isn't intended to be a working application.  I intend to use this
to perform static analysis against the generated binary IPA.  The resulting
app will be used as a test case for programmatic identification of iOS 
applications that leverage the Twitter SDK.

Instructions:
1) Install rvm
2) Install bundler
```
$ gem install bundler
```
3) Install cocoapods gem
``` 
$ bundle install
```
4) Install
